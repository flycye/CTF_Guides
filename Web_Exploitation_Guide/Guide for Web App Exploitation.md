# Guide for Web App Exploitation

# Beginner Concepts

üéâ Goal: Understand basic web application vulnerabilities, how they arise from insecure design, and how attackers exploit them using malformed requests or weak input validation.

## Web Attacks

### HTTP Verb Tampering

Sends malicious requests using unexpected HTTP methods.

Goal: Bypass a site‚Äôs authorization mechanisms or security controls.

Common HTTP Verbs:

OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, CONNECT, etc.

üõ°Ô∏è Solution: Disable all non-GET or non-POST methods on the server or restrict them via a WAF.

### Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

The backend uses predictable identifiers like sequential numbers or user IDs.

Goal: Access unauthorized resources by guessing identifiers.

### XML External Entity (XXE) Injection

A web app uses outdated XML parsers to handle user-supplied XML input.

Goal: Disclose local files or internal systems from the backend.

### HTTP Verb Reference

| OPTIONS | Shows options accepted by a web server, like accepted HTTP verbs |
| --- | --- |
| HEAD | Identical to GET request, but only contains headers |
| PATCH | Apply partial modifications to the resource of some location |

### Insecure Coding

Q: What is Web Exploitation?
A: Web exploitation is the art of exploiting flaws in web applications. This includes leveraging how web apps handle data, sessions, etc. to access or modify data without authorization.
