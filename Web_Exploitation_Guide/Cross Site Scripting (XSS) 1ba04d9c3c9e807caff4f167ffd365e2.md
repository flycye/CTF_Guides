# Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

## **Overview**

XSS is a type of vulnerability usually found in web applications, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into webpages.

## **Process**

1. An attacker will inject a snippet of malicious code -- such as JavaScript -- into an input field on a web page, for example.
2. The user visits that webpage and unknowingly runs the code in their browser.
3. This can provide an attacker with users' sensitive information and/or credentials.
4. Attackers can then leverage the user's details to take control of their session.

## **What weaknesses does XSS exploit?**

From a defender's perspective, there are multiple ways to

**prevent**

attackers from injecting malicious code.

- User input validation
- User input sanitization

## **Discovery**

to discover various vulnerabilities, we can use both automated and manual methods

### **Automated methods**

we can perform automated discovery with

**vulnerability scanners**

- nessus
- burp suite pro
- zap

### **Manual discovery**

to manually discover such vulnerabilities, we can:

- test various payloads against an input field
- manually review the source code

> to view the source code of a site, use the hotkey

> Ctrl + U
