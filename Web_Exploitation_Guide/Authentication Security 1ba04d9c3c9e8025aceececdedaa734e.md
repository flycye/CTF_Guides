# Authentication Security

Created: March 18, 2025 10:55 AM

Authentication systems can be attacked in many ways, whether that is by brute-forcing passwords or performing session attacks.

### **User Enumeration**

When attempting to signup/login to a website, it may often tell you if a username already exists. This makes it easier for attackers to target specific user accounts.

### **Brute-Forcing**

Brute forcing can be done in many ways for a webapp. Attempting many passwords on targeted, known usernames (

**password spraying**

) or

**credential stuffing**

are commonly used methods.

Additionally, we can brute force (password) reset tokens. A

**reset token**

is some secret data generated by an application when a user requests a password reset.

This can be done if a password reset system is generating tokens with a few digits. We can use this same approach for

**brute-forcing TOTPs**

### **Default Credentials**

When an entity sets up a website, there will often be some supplied

**default credentials**

. For example, for OWASP the default credentials are (admin, password).

## **Direct Access**

This method pertains to accessing protected resources directly by going to some endpoint, for example

```
/admin.php
```

.

## **Parameter Modification**

If we notice that requests made include (for example)

```
admin.php?user_id=#
```

, we can brute-force or guess a user id that might give us admin access

## **Session Attacks (Tokens)**

**Session tokens**

are unique ids that a website uses to identify a given user. If it's too short or cryptographically weak, we can brute-force it to obtain control of a user's session.

examples of session attacks:

- session fixation
- improper session timeout
